# Maze_Solver_Robot
Autonomous robot to negotiate a maze in the shortest possible time. Colloborated with three colleagues to design, programme a maze solver robot to solve a 9 x 9 size maze. We have succesfully designed an autonomous robot using DC motors, Ultrasonic sensors, IR sensor, Voltage regulator, Motor drivers and Arduino Uno microcontroller. We have successfully programmed the robot to solve the maze. Using the DFS (Depth-First Search) Algorithm to explore the maze form the starting cell to the goal cell. Through the implemetation of DFS algorithm the robot will navigate through each potential path untill it reaches the dead end. Once it reaches the dead end robot will backtrack and explore another potential path until it finsd the goal. We used Flood Fill Algorithm to keep track on visited cells. Through the implementation of this algorithm, the robot will mark the visited cells. This will help to reduce the loop movements of the robot by cheching whether the cell particular cell has visited already. Once the goal is achieved, the return path can be constructed to the staring cell of the maze using the marked cells (Flood Fill Algorithm). Then using the cell data of the maze(wall, paths) now the robot will find the shortest path to reach the goal cell from the start cell.
